# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Random Forests

This work shows how random forests can be used to learn a model to classify and predict handwritten
digits.
First, the 28x28 greyscale images of handwritten digits are imported as a vector of length 784 with
values between 0 and 255. The training data also contains their labels (the number it displays).
Then, the random forest classifier is learnt and applied to the test data.

## Data Set

The data set is taken from the respective kaggle.com challenge, and you can find my kernel here: https://www.kaggle.com/michaelnie/simple-random-forest-classification/

## Results

The employed classifier achieved an accuracy of nearly 94% which is quite remarkable considering its
simplicity. 

# Final Remarks

I hope you enjoy the introduction to handwritten digit classification with random forests. If you
have any questions, please let me know!
